	Firstly, I am grateful for working with for the guidance and mentorship
	of my advisor Dr.~Ioannis A.\ Kakadiaris --- in both research and personal
	matters. Dr.~Kakadiaris kept me on track and made sure that I had the
	resources to keep organized. His many suggestions for improving my
	work were valuable and those lessons will stay with me.

	In addition, I would like to thank my committee, Prof.~Shishir Shah and
	Prof.~Emanuel Papadakis for asking interesting questions and pushing me to
	learn and try new ideas both inside and outside the classroom.

	I would like to also thank Prof.~Demetrio Labate, Prof.~Emanuel Papadakis,
	Pankaj Singh, Burcin Ozcan, Pooran Negi, and Paul Hernandez-Herrera for
	enlightening discussions during our neuroscience research meetings and
	the image analysis seminars in the Department of Mathematics.

	To the members of the Computational Biomedicine Lab over the years
	of my undergraduate and graduate studies
	---
	I learned a lot from our conversations which sparked ideas for further
	research and new ways of approaching computer science and software engineering.
	Being able to learn from the diversity of projects in the lab was a
	quite enjoyable experience.

	I would like to acknowledge my family for their patience during the
	many hours that I would dissappear to work at the lab. I could not have
	completed my thesis without their help and encouragement.
