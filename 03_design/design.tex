% FIXME
% explain the importance of the Design phase
Once the planning is done, the actual technical details of the
project are determined in the Design phase. This phase is not a
discrete step that is separate from the following Implementation
phase; as the implementation continues, the Design is updated to
take into account new information. As such, it is important that
the Design is able to incorporate incremental changes otherwise
adding new changes will become difficult --- especially
when fundamental data structures need to be modified. The following
details these design decisions.

\section{Incorporation of \glsentrytext{orionmat}}

% start with MATLAB code and why
Since the algorithm already exists as a design in the \gls{orionmat}
implementation, this can be leveraged as a starting point for the
conversion. This means that the structure of \gls{orionc} will
start off with the same structure as the MATLAB version. This is
to reduce the cognitive load when rewriting and testing each
component because the inputs and outputs remain the same and
keeping the names the same makes it easier to navigate between
corresponding functions.

% TODO describe naming convention and the way of linking back to original implementation

\section{Algorithms and architecture}

The architecture of a software system includes both the individual
components and how they interact with one another and the core
data structures that are used to transfer data between the
components. The following description of the architecture will
approach these details from the top-down.

The ORION algorithm consists of three parts (as shown in \cref{fig:high-level-arch}),
namely
\begin{description}[font=\textpluscolon]
	\item[Segmentation] to label the
		foreground and the background of the image;
	\item[Registration] for aligning subvolumes so
		that they can be used to create a single volume;
		and
	\item[Tracing] to extract a centerline from the volume to
		capture the underlying neuron morphology.
\end{description}

% TODO add information about the convention used to nodes shapes

diagram of ORION algorithm}: This high-level diagram shows that
there are three steps to the \gls{orionmat} algorithm as described
in the text. The input to the algorithm is a 3D volume of
microscopy data and the output is a graph-based representation of
the neuron morphology based on the centerline.}\label{fig:high-level-arch}

\subsection{Segmentation}

As depicted in \cref{fig:proc-segmentation}, the
segmentation process performs one-class classification using the
background voxels to learn a discriminant function for extracting
vessel-like structures. The segmentation uses a multiscale approach so that
both thin and thick neurite structures can be extracted at once from a single
volume.

	\enumdescitem{Obtain background training data} This step is used
		to bootstrap the learning process so that a quick
		approximation of the distribution of background
		and foreground voxels can be determined
		(\cref{alg:seg_bg_train}).
	\enumdescitem{Obtain vessellness features} This step is used to
		obtain features that are used to discriminate
		vessel-like structures
		(\cref{alg:seg_vessellness}).
	\enumdescitem{Learn discriminant function} Here an accumulator is used to
		characterize the distribution of the vessellness features
		(\cref{alg:seg_discrim}).
	\enumdescitem{Threshold} Using the discriminant function from the previous
		step, the volume is segmented into foreground and background classes
		(\cref{alg:seg_threshold}).
	\enumdescitem{Post-processing} Removal of artifacts such as small connected components
		(\cref{alg:seg_post}).
