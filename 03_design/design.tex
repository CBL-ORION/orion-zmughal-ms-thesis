Once the planning is done, the actual technical details of the
project are determined in the Design phase. This phase is

% - use the initial MATLAB code as a design and refactor

Since the algorithm already exists as a design in the MATLAB
implementation, this can be used as a starting point for the
conversion. To initiate this, we need an overview of the
