@article{Open-Curve-Snake-Wang2011,
	abstract = {This paper presents a broadly applicable algorithm and a comprehensive open-source software implementation for automated tracing of neuronal structures in 3-D microscopy images. The core 3-D neuron tracing algorithm is based on three-dimensional (3-D) open-curve active Contour (Snake). It is initiated from a set of automatically detected seed points. Its evolution is driven by a combination of deforming forces based on the Gradient Vector Flow (GVF), stretching forces based on estimation of the fiber orientations, and a set of control rules. In this tracing model, bifurcation points are detected implicitly as points where multiple snakes collide. A boundariness measure is employed to allow local radius estimation. A suite of pre-processing algorithms enable the system to accommodate diverse neuronal image datasets by reducing them to a common image format. The above algorithms form the basis for a comprehensive, scalable, and efficient software system developed for confocal or brightfield images. It provides multiple automated tracing modes. The user can optionally interact with the tracing system using multiple view visualization, and exercise full control to ensure a high quality reconstruction. We illustrate the utility of this tracing system by presenting results from a synthetic dataset, a brightfield dataset and two confocal datasets from the DIADEM challenge.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a general framework for extracting 3D centerlines from volumetric datasets. Unlike the majority of previous approaches, we do not require a prior segmentation of the volume nor we do assume any particular tubular shape. Centerline extraction is performed using a morphology-guided level set model. Our approach consists of: i) learning the structural patterns of a tubular-like object, and ii) estimating the centerline of a tubular object as the path with minimal cost with respect to outward flux in gray level images. Such shortest path is found by solving the Eikonal equation. We compare the performance of our method with existing approaches in synthetic, CT, and multiphoton 3D images, obtaining substantial improvements, especially in the case of irregular tubular objects.},

In this paper, we address these challenges and present a computational framework for an automatic, three-dimensional (3D) morphological reconstruction of live nerve cells. The key aspects of this approach are: (i) detection of neuronal dendrites through learning 3D tubular models, and (ii) skeletonization by a new algorithm using a morphology-guided deformable model for extracting the dendritic centerline. To represent the neuron morphology, we introduce a novel representation, the Minimum Shape-Cost (MSC) Tree that approximates the dendrite centerline with sub-voxel accuracy and demonstrate the uniqueness of such a shape representation as well as its computational efficiency. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative results that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method.},

@article{Mukherjee2014,
	abstract = {A segmentation framework is proposed to trace neurons from confocal microscopy images. With an increasing demand for high throughput neuronal image analysis, we propose an automated scheme to perform segmentation in a variational framework. Our segmentation technique, called tubularity flow field (TuFF) performs directional regional growing guided by the direction of tubularity of the neurites. We further address the problem of sporadic signal variation in confocal microscopy by designing a local attraction force field which is able to bridge the gaps between local neurite fragments, even in the case of complete signal loss. Segmentation is performed in an integrated fashion by incorporating the directional region growing and the attraction force based motion in a single framework using level sets. This segmentation is accomplished without manual seed point selection; it is automated. The performance of TuFF is demonstrated over a set of 2-D and 3-D confocal microscopy images where we report an improvement of above 75{\%} in terms of mean absolute error over three extensively used neuron segmentation algorithms. Two novel features of the variational solution, the evolution force and the attraction force, hold promise as contributions that can be employed in a number of image analysis applications.},

We introduce a stochastic Marked Point Process framework for fully automatic extraction of tubular structures requiring no user interaction or seed points for initialization. Our Marked Point Process model enables unsupervised network extraction by fitting a configuration of objects with globally optimal associated energy to the centreline of the arbors. For this purpose we propose special configurations of marked objects and an energy function well adapted for detection of 3D tubular branches. The optimization of the energy function is achieved by a stochastic, discrete-time multiple birth and death dynamics. Our method finds the centreline, local width and orientation of neuronal arbors and identifies critical nodes like bifurcations and terminals. The proposed model is tested on 3D light microscopy images from the DIADEM data set with promising results.},

	abstract = {Digital reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) neuronal morphology from light microscopy images provides a powerful technique for analysis of neural circuits. It is time-consuming to manually perform this process. Thus, efficient computer-assisted approaches are preferable. In this paper, we present an innovative method for the tracing and reconstruction of 3D neuronal morphology from light microscopy images. The method uses a prediction and refinement strategy that is based on exploration of local neuron structural features. We extended the rayburst sampling algorithm to a marching fashion, which starts from a single or a few seed points and marches recursively forward along neurite branches to trace and reconstruct the whole tree-like structure. A local radius-related but size-independent hemispherical sampling was used to predict the neurite centerline and detect branches. Iterative rayburst sampling was performed in the orthogonal plane, to refine the centerline location and to estimate the local radius. We implemented the method in a cooperative 3D interactive visualization-assisted system named flNeuronTool. The source code in C++ and the binaries are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/flneurontool/. We validated and evaluated the proposed method using synthetic data and real datasets from the Digital Reconstruction of Axonal and Dendritic Morphology (DIADEM) challenge. Then, flNeuronTool was applied to mouse brain images acquired with the Micro-Optical Sectioning Tomography (MOST) system, to reconstruct single neurons and local neural circuits. The results showed that the system achieves a reasonable balance between fast speed and acceptable accuracy, which is promising for interactive applications in neuronal image analysis.},

	abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster is a well-studied model organism, especially in the field of neurophysiology and neural circuits. The brain of the Drosophila is small but complex, and the image of a single neuron in the brain can be acquired using confocal microscopy. Analyzing the Drosophila brain is an ideal start to understanding the neural structure. The most fundamental task in studying the neural network of Drosophila is to reconstruct neuronal structures from image stacks. Although the fruit fly brain is small, it contains approximately 100,000 neurons. It is impossible to trace all the neurons manually. This study presents a high-throughput algorithm for reconstructing the neuronal structures from 3D image stacks collected by a laser scanning confocal microscope. The proposed method reconstructs the neuronal structure by applying the shortest path graph algorithm. The vertices in the graph are certain points on the 2D skeletons of the neuron in the slices. These points are close to the 3D centerlines of the neuron branches. The accuracy of the algorithm was verified using the DIADEM data set. This method has been adopted as part of the protocol of the FlyCircuit Database, and was successfully applied to process more than 16,000 neurons. This study also shows that further analysis based on the reconstruction results can be performed to gather more information on the neural network.},

	abstract = {Digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology are used to

			conditions. Although many measures exist to analyze
			differences between neurons, none is particularly
			suitable to compare the same arborizing structure over
			time (morphological change) or reconstructed by
			different people and/or software (morphological error).
			The metric introduced for the DIADEM (DIgital
			reconstruction of Axonal and DEndritic Morphology)
			Challenge quantifies the similarity between two
			reconstructions of the same neuron by matching the
			locations of bifurcations and terminations as well as
			their topology between the two reconstructed arbors.
			The DIADEM metric was specifically designed to capture
			the most critical aspects in automating neuronal
			reconstructions, and can function in feedback loops
			during algorithm development. During the Challenge, the
			metric scored the automated reconstructions of
			best-performing algorithms against manually traced gold
			standards over a representative data set collection.
			The metric was compared with direct quality assessments
			by neuronal reconstruction experts and with clocked
			human tracing time saved by automation. The results
			indicate that relevant morphological features were
			properly quantified in spite of subjectivity in the
			underlying image data and varying research goals. The

@article{Costa2014,
	abstract = {Efforts to map neural circuits from model organisms including flies and mice are now generating multi-terabyte datasets of 10,000s of labelled neurons. Technologies such as dense EM based reconstruction, and sparse/multicolor labeling with image registration allow neurons to be embedded within the spatial context of a circuit or a whole brain. These ever-expanding data demand new computational tools to search, organize and navigate neurons. We present a simple, but fast and sensitive, algorithm, NBLAST, for measuring pairwise neuronal similarity by position and local geometry. Inspired by the BLAST algorithm for biological sequence data, NBLAST decomposes a query and target neuron into short segments. Each matched segment pair is scored using a log-likelihood ratio scoring matrix empirically defined by the statistics of real matches and non-matches in the data. We demonstrate the application of a reference implementation of NBLAST to a dataset of 16,129 single Drosophila neurons. NBLAST scores are sensitive enough to distinguish 1) two images of the same neuron, 2) two neurons of the same identified neuronal type 3) two neurons of very closely related types. We demonstrate that NBLAST scores can be used to identify neuronal types, such as olfactory projection neurons, with reliability that matches or exceeds expert annotation in a fraction of the time. We also show that clustering using appropriately normalized NBLAST scores can reveal classic morphological types as well as identify unpublished classes. We carry out detailed analysis of a number of neuronal classes including Kenyon cells, olfactory and visual projection neurons, auditory, and male-specific P1 neurons. This identifies many new neuronal types and reveals unreported features of topographic organization. Finally we provide a complete clustering of the 16,129 neurons in the test dataset into 1,052 clusters of highly related neurons. These clusters are then organized into superclusters, enabling both exploration of the dataset and the matching of individual clusters to morphological types in the literature. Finally NBLAST queries can be used to identify candidate neurons matching neurite tracts with transgene expression pattern. We provide a general purpose open source toolbox that implements construction of score matrices, the core pairwise scoring algorithm, de novo and precomputed database search and clustering along with complete source code and data for the analyses in this paper. The neuronal families can also be queried online through virtualflybrain.org and visualized in interactive 3D at jefferislab.org.},

Initially we have included full three-dimensional representations of 87 neurons from the hippocampus, obtained following intracellular staining with biocytin and reconstruction using Neurolucida. The archive system includes a structure editor for correcting any departures from valid branching geometry and which allows simple errors in the digitisation to be corrected. The editor employs a platform-independent file format which enforces the constraints that there should be no isolated branches and no closed loops. It also incorporates software for interconversion between the archive format and those used by various neuronal reconstruction and modelling packages. The raw data from digitisation software can be included in the archive as well as edited reconstructions and any further information available. Cross-referenced tables and indexes are updated automatically and are sorted according to a number of fields including the cell type, contributor, submission date and published reference. Both the archive and the structure editor should facilitate the quantitative use of full three-dimensional reconstructions of neurons from the hippocampus and other brain regions.},

	abstract = {The importance of neuronal morphology has been recognized from the early days of neuroscience. Elucidating the functional roles of axonal and dendritic arbors in synaptic integration, signal transmission, network connectivity, and circuit dynamics requires quantitative analyses of digital three-dimensional reconstructions. We extensively searched the scientific literature for all original reports describing reconstructions of neuronal morphology since the advent of this technique three decades ago. From almost 50,000 titles, 30,000 abstracts, and more than 10,000 full-text articles, we identified 902 publications describing ∼44,000 digital reconstructions. Reviewing the growth of this field exposed general research trends on specific animal species, brain regions, neuron types, and experimental approaches. The entire bibliography, annotated with relevant metadata and (wherever available) direct links to the underlying digital data, is accessible at NeuroMorpho.Org.},

	abstract = {The connectivity architecture of neuronal circuits is essential to understand how brains work, yet our knowledge about the neuronal wiring diagrams remains limited and partial. Technical breakthroughs in labeling and imaging methods starting more than a century ago have advanced knowledge in the field. However, the volume of data associated with imaging a whole brain or a significant fraction thereof, with electron or light microscopy, has only recently become amenable to digital storage and analysis. A mouse brain imaged at light-microscopic resolution is about a terabyte of data, and 1mm $\backslash$n                        3 of the brain at EM resolution is about half a petabyte. This has given rise to a new field of research, computational analysis of large-scale neuroanatomical data sets, with goals that include reconstructions of the morphology of individual neurons as well as entire circuits. The problems encountered include large data management, segmentation and 3D reconstruction, computational geometry and workflow management allowing for hybrid approaches combining manual and algorithmic processing. Here we review this growing field of neuronal data analysis with emphasis on reconstructing neurons from EM data cubes. ?? 2012.},

@article{NeuroMorphVariability:Parekh:2015,
	abstract = {Digital reconstructions of axonal and dendritic arbors provide a powerful representation of neuronal morphology in formats amenable to quantitative analysis, computational modeling, and data mining. Reconstructed files, however, require adequate metadata to identify the appropriate animal species, developmental stage, brain region, and neuron type. Moreover, experimental details about tissue processing, neurite visualization and microscopic imaging are essential to assess the information content of digital morphologies. Typical morphological reconstructions only partially capture the underlying biological reality. Tracings are often limited to certain domains (e.g., dendrites and not axons), may be incomplete due to tissue sectioning, imperfect staining, and limited imaging resolution, or can disregard aspects irrelevant to their specific scientific focus (such as branch thickness or depth). Gauging these factors is critical in subsequent data reuse and comparison. NeuroMorpho.Org is a central repository of reconstructions from many laboratories and experimental conditions. Here, we introduce substantial additions to the existing metadata annotation aimed to describe the completeness of the reconstructed neurons in NeuroMorpho.Org. These expanded metadata form a suitable basis for effective description of neuromorphological data.},

@article{Markram2013,
	abstract = {Although twenty-first century neuroscience is a major scientific enterprise, advances in basic research have not yet translated into benefits for society. In this paper, I outline seven fundamental challenges that need to be overcome. First, neuroscience has to become "big science" - we need big teams with the resources and competences to tackle the big problems. Second, we need to create interlinked sets of data providing a complete picture of single areas of the brain at their different levels of organization with "rungs" linking the descriptions for humans and other species. Such "data ladders" will help us to meet the third challenge - the development of efficient predictive tools, enabling us to drastically increase the information we can extract from expensive experiments. The fourth challenge goes one step further: we have to develop novel hardware and software sufficiently powerful to simulate the brain. In the future, supercomputer-based brain simulation will enable us to make in silico manipulations and recordings, which are currently completely impossible in the lab. The fifth and sixth challenges are translational. On the one hand we need to develop new ways of classifying and simulating brain disease, leading to better diagnosis and more effective drug discovery. On the other, we have to exploit our knowledge to build new brain-inspired technologies, with potentially huge benefits for industry and for society. This leads to the seventh challenge. Neuroscience can indeed deliver huge benefits but we have to be aware of widespread social concern about our work. We need to recognize the fears that exist, lay them to rest, and actively build public support for neuroscience research. We have to set goals for ourselves that the public can recognize and share. And then we have to deliver on our promises. Only in this way, will we receive the support and funding we need.},

@article{Wilson2006,
	abstract = {For the past few years, we’ve had the opportunity, as software engineers, to observe the development of computational-science software (called codes) built for high-performance-computing (HPC) machines in many different contexts. Although we haven’t studied all types of HPC development, we’ve encountered a wide cross-section of projects. Despite these projects’ diversity, several common traits exist: Many developers receive their software training from other scientists. Although the scientists often have been writing software for many years, they generally lack formal software engineering (SE) training, especially in managing multiperson development teams and complex software artifacts. Many of the codes aren’t initially designed to be large. They start small and then grow on the basis of their scientific success. Many development teams use their own code (or code developed as part of their research group). For these reasons (and many others), development ■ ■ ■ practices in this community differ considerably from those in more “traditional” SE. We aim here to distill our experience about how software engineers can productively engage the HPC community. Several SE practices generally considered good ideas in other development environments are quite mismatched to the HPC community’s needs. For SE researchers, the keys to successful interactions include a healthy sense of humility and the avoidance of assumptions that SE expertise applies equally in all contexts.},

	abstract = {Scientific computation is emerging as absolutely central to the scientific method. Unfortunately, it’s error-prone and currently immature—traditional scientific publication is incapable of finding and rooting out errors in scientific computation—which must be recognized as a crisis. An important recent development and a necessary response to the crisis is reproducible computational research in which researchers publish the article along with the full computational environment that produces the results. The authors have practiced reproducible computational research for 15 years and have integrated it with their scientific research and with doctoral and postdoctoral education. In this article, they review their approach and how it has evolved over time, discussing the arguments for and against working reproducibly.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
