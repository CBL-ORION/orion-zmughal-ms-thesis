			center lines and corresponding local cylinder radii are
			important for the study of vascular diseases, and in
			the brain also important for the modeling and

			tracking based approaches, artificial based approaches, neural
			network based approaches, and miscellaneous tube-like

			for the extraction of vasculature networks in the brain

			mice brain imagery obtained for the purpose of studying
			hemodynamic effects on neural activity are promising.},

@article{DIADEM-metric-Gillette2011,
	abstract = {Digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology are used to
			study neuron function, development, and responses to various
			conditions. Although many measures exist to analyze
			differences between neurons, none is particularly
			suitable to compare the same arborizing structure over
			time (morphological change) or reconstructed by
			different people and/or software (morphological error).
			The metric introduced for the DIADEM (DIgital
			reconstruction of Axonal and DEndritic Morphology)
			Challenge quantifies the similarity between two
			reconstructions of the same neuron by matching the
			locations of bifurcations and terminations as well as
			their topology between the two reconstructed arbors.
			The DIADEM metric was specifically designed to capture
			the most critical aspects in automating neuronal
			reconstructions, and can function in feedback loops
			during algorithm development. During the Challenge, the
			metric scored the automated reconstructions of
			best-performing algorithms against manually traced gold
			standards over a representative data set collection.
			The metric was compared with direct quality assessments
			by neuronal reconstruction experts and with clocked
			human tracing time saved by automation. The results
			indicate that relevant morphological features were
			properly quantified in spite of subjectivity in the
			underlying image data and varying research goals. The

Initially we have included full three-dimensional representations of 87 neurons from the hippocampus, obtained following intracellular staining with biocytin and reconstruction using Neurolucida. The archive system includes a structure editor for correcting any departures from valid branching geometry and which allows simple errors in the digitisation to be corrected. The editor employs a platform-independent file format which enforces the constraints that there should be no isolated branches and no closed loops. It also incorporates software for interconversion between the archive format and those used by various neuronal reconstruction and modelling packages. The raw data from digitisation software can be included in the archive as well as edited reconstructions and any further information available. Cross-referenced tables and indexes are updated automatically and are sorted according to a number of fields including the cell type, contributor, submission date and published reference. Both the archive and the structure editor should facilitate the quantitative use of full three-dimensional reconstructions of neurons from the hippocampus and other brain regions.},

@article{Open-Curve-Snake-Wang2011,
	abstract = {This paper presents a broadly applicable algorithm and a comprehensive open-source software implementation for automated tracing of neuronal structures in 3-D microscopy images. The core 3-D neuron tracing algorithm is based on three-dimensional (3-D) open-curve active Contour (Snake). It is initiated from a set of automatically detected seed points. Its evolution is driven by a combination of deforming forces based on the Gradient Vector Flow (GVF), stretching forces based on estimation of the fiber orientations, and a set of control rules. In this tracing model, bifurcation points are detected implicitly as points where multiple snakes collide. A boundariness measure is employed to allow local radius estimation. A suite of pre-processing algorithms enable the system to accommodate diverse neuronal image datasets by reducing them to a common image format. The above algorithms form the basis for a comprehensive, scalable, and efficient software system developed for confocal or brightfield images. It provides multiple automated tracing modes. The user can optionally interact with the tracing system using multiple view visualization, and exercise full control to ensure a high quality reconstruction. We illustrate the utility of this tracing system by presenting results from a synthetic dataset, a brightfield dataset and two confocal datasets from the DIADEM challenge.},

Such shortest path is found by solving the Eikonal equation.
