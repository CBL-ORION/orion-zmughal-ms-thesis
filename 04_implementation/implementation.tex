As discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:design}, the Implementation stage
starts by converting the MATLAB code to native code by following

\section{Data structures}

The main data structure used in the implementation is an
n-dimensional array or tensor. Since the algorithm is meant to
work with 3D data, the
