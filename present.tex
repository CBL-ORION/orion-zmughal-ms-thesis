\section{Related work}
%  - Related Work - a catchy name is “State of the Art”.
%        Literature review relevant to specific research. Your committee
%        members are expected to already have a general background in your field.
%        Concentrate on the details of your specific research area. It is preferable to
%        use more recent literature (except for some classical “old” ones). Also avoid
%        reviewing standard concepts that have been around for a long time.

\section{Proposed framework}
%  - Proposed Framework - this is the most important part of your proposal.
%        Expect most questions from committee members on this. Put in all your
%        best here. Describe the entire framework before separating into work-done and
%        work-left. Do not mix framework with results. You may start with a one-slide
%        overview of the entire framework before going into details. Make sure committee
%        members will be able to understand your work. Relate to previous approaches and
%        how your is an extension or a difference. Include mathematical equations that
%        will explain your work.
%  - Explain the relevance of each equation. Understand the meaning and
%        significance of each term in the equation irrespective of whether you define
%        them in the slide or not. TIP: Rather than doing your equation twice (for your
%        PPT and Latex write-up), you may do it once in your Latex document and copy
%        into TexPoint for the PPT.

	[\tbackground{analysis of existing codebase; how this informs the new
	implementation; why use the call graph instead of
	attempting to either do a clean room implementation (i.e.,
	by only reading papers) or creating a new architecture
	from scratch}]

\begin{frame}\frametitle{\subsecname}
	[\tbackground{how to integrate with Vaa3D}\tmetrics{a

\section{Results}
%  - Preliminary Results - if you already have some results, please show it.
%        Talk about how you propose to validate your results. Show how your
%        results compare with previous results OR how it performs in general, (e.g., in
%        how many images it succeeded or in how many it failed). A chart will be useful.
%        Any statistical comparison should indicate level of significance.
%  - Present status of the proposed framework
%        - which aspects are completed, which are in progress, and which have not yet been done at all.
%  - It is advisable to include a timeline of future indicating milestones and when you hope to achieve each.
%  - Expected Impact - mention specific application areas where you have tried or will try your proposed framework.
%        Also, explain how it can be generalized to other areas in Computer
%        Science. What is the overall benefit for the community? What is the
%        contribution to Computer Science research?
