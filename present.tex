%  - Problem Statement - Goals, objectives, aims. May also include challenges.
%        IMPORTANT: State your specific aims clearly - what you plan to achieve and how
%        you plan to achieve it. Let your contributions to the field of Computer Science
%        be clear.

\begin{frame}[label=challenges]
\frametitle{Challenges and risks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Starting without a test suite
	\item Memory management
	\item Data layout differences of n-dimensional arrays
	\item Data handling differences
	\item Reimplement MATLAB Toolbox functions
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Integrate with Vaa3D tool for biomedical image analysis
	\item Convert the MATLAB code to C / C++
	\item Release code as free/open source software for open-science
	\item Build a test suite
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Analysis}

\section{Design}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Design}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use the original MATLAB code as initial design: followed by refactoring the C code
	\item Automated GNU Make-based build system:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item compiler extension configuration
			\item third-party library build flag configuration
			\item prerequisite scanning
		\end{itemize}
	\item Available on GitHub for public visibility
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Implementation}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Base data structure is an n-dimensional array (row-major buffer with shape metadata)
	\item float32 for storage; float64 for calculations
	\item In-memory calculations
	\item ITK library used for implementing several filters
	\item Branch-based component development
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Testing}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use the Test Anything Protocol (TAP) for test output
	\item Continuous integration with a pull request based workflow
	\item Automatic provisioning of build environment
	\item Tracing-based comparison to original MATLAB function
	\item Assertions for pre-/post-conditions
	\item External dependencies managed using version control
	\item Integration testing with Vaa3D plugin
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Discussion}

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Software is an ever-changing system
	\item The code depends on an ecosystem
	\item Rewrites across languages are difficult
	\item Scientific software engineering is very much like traditional software engineering
	\item Open-science and reproducibility for computational methods requires software engineering skills
\end{itemize}

%  - Related Work - a catchy name is “State of the Art”.
%        Literature review relevant to specific research. Your committee
%        members are expected to already have a general background in your field.
%        Concentrate on the details of your specific research area. It is preferable to
%        use more recent literature (except for some classical “old” ones). Also avoid
%        reviewing standard concepts that have been around for a long time.
%  - Proposed Framework - this is the most important part of your proposal.
%        Expect most questions from committee members on this. Put in all your
%        best here. Describe the entire framework before separating into work-done and
%        work-left. Do not mix framework with results. You may start with a one-slide
%        overview of the entire framework before going into details. Make sure committee
%        members will be able to understand your work. Relate to previous approaches and
%        how your is an extension or a difference. Include mathematical equations that
%        will explain your work.
%  - Explain the relevance of each equation. Understand the meaning and
%        significance of each term in the equation irrespective of whether you define
%        them in the slide or not. TIP: Rather than doing your equation twice (for your
%        PPT and Latex write-up), you may do it once in your Latex document and copy
%        into TexPoint for the PPT.
%  - Preliminary Results - if you already have some results, please show it.
%        Talk about how you propose to validate your results. Show how your
%        results compare with previous results OR how it performs in general, (e.g., in
%        how many images it succeeded or in how many it failed). A chart will be useful.
%        Any statistical comparison should indicate level of significance.
%  - Present status of the proposed framework
%        - which aspects are completed, which are in progress, and which have not yet been done at all.
%  - It is advisable to include a timeline of future indicating milestones and when you hope to achieve each.
%  - Expected Impact - mention specific application areas where you have tried or will try your proposed framework.
%        Also, explain how it can be generalized to other areas in Computer
%        Science. What is the overall benefit for the community? What is the
%        contribution to Computer Science research?
%  - Conclusion slide could be catchy, something they will remember.
%        Maybe an animation, video, or terse statement that summarizes it all.
%  - Publications - you should list your publications or mention them in relevant sections of the presentation.
