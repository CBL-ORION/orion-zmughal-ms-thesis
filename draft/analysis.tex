\section{Analysis}

In order to understand how the ORION MATLAB code is structured, it
is necessary to first get the call graph of the code. There is a
tool built in to MATLAB to do this called
depfun

, however this tool runs slowly when running on the entire codebase.
There is an alternative called fdep

The output of this tool is graph that
