\chapter{ORION3 MATLAB Callgraph}

In order to understand how the ORION MATLAB code is structured, it
is necessary to first get the call graph of the code. There is a
tool built in to MATLAB to do this called
depfun
\url{http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/depfun.html} % TODO turn into citation
, however this tool runs slowly when running on the entire codebase.
There is an alternative called fdep
